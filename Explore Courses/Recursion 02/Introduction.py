# Introduction
# We have discussed about the basic concepts and techniques about the recursion in the
# previous explore card called Recursion 01.
# In this card, we will dive deeper into the theme of recursion. In particular, we will
# cover some paradigms that are often applied together with the recursion to solve
# some problems.
# Here are list of topics that we will cover in this card:
# 1. Divide and Conquer
# 2. Backtracking
# 3. Master Theorem

# Prerequisite: Stack, Recursion 01
