# Introduction
# Recursion is an important concept in computer science. It is the foundation for many
# other algorithms and data structures. However, the concept of recursion can be tricky
# to grasp for many beginners.
# Before getting started with this card, we strongly recommend that you complete the
# binary tree and stack cards first.
# In this explore card, we answer the following questions:
# 1. what is recursion? How does it work?
# 2. How to solve a problem recursively?
# 3. How to analyze the time and space complexity of a recursive algorithm?
# 4. How can we apply recursion in a better way?
# After completing this card, you will find more confident in solving problems recursively
# and analyzing the complexity on your own.

# Prerequisite: Binary Tree, Stack
